As an avid "Animal Crossing: New Horizon" fan I am on https://turnip.exchange/islands daily checking the current Turnip Prices.

Initially I would manually grab the latest Turnip Prices manually, sort them and share them in our "Animal Crossing" Slack Channel at work.

As an Automation Engineer I knew I could do so much better, so I created the following script that manipulates the UI and grabs the data I need.


# SETUP
1. `mvn clean install`

2. Run the `main()` function.

3. Example output:

    * ```[196, 452, 554, 439, 456, 498, 356, 638, 330, 183, 523, 197, 480, 149, 355, 454, 190, 262, 109, 451, 575, 267, 288, 121, 166, 286, 518, 421, 133, 480]```


# TODO

* Retrieve additional details:

    * Link to the Island queue
    * Island details
    * Current queue
